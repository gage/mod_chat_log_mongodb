* Requirement:

erlmongo

* Configuration:

ejabberd.cfg
{mod_chat_log_mongodb, [{hosts, ["localhost:27017"]}, {db, "xmpp"}, {collection, "message"}]},

* Usage

I've included a sample ./run script to get things up and running quickly.  You'll need
to change paths and remove the lager portion if you don't use it.  In production these
should probably be real app dependencies.
